			He's so tall and handsome as hell<br>
			He's so bad, but he does it so well<br>
			I can see the end as it begins<br>
			My one condition is<br>
			Say you'll remember me<br>
			Standing in a nice dress<br>
			Staring at the sunset, babe<br>
			Red lips and rosy cheeks<br>
			Say you'll see me again<br>
			Even if it's just in your wildest dreams.<br>

			<p style="color:#91a3b0;">
				london? it has always been my dream. When I was a child there was a famous actress Katrina Kaif, she was from london and she spoke such fluent english that the 5 year old me was falling in love with a city itself. I've always been a dreamer but it wasn't dragons and pirates that I dreamt of, rather it has always been the tall buildings and bright night lights.

			<h4 style="color: #c4c3d0;">The Big Apple, NewYorkCity</h4>
			<p style="color:#91a3b0;">
				The big apple as they like to call it, why? frankly I don't know but what i do know is for a city like newyork which is known for its skylights, the city that never sleeps where you and i and many like us want to go in big dreams and hopes, I wanna live in this city too and its not for the celebrities or it being one of the most bustling places, its just my city girl side speaking.

			<h4 style="color: #c4c3d0;">A home in Los Angeles</h4>
			<p style="color:#91a3b0;">
				The world's center of television and network, centered in california this city is known for its bustling nature, and me? I love music and I love movies so why wouldn't I want to visit LA and go to the hollywoods? if newyork is the dream city for people like me, this is the dream for those who want to be on the big screen. and aside from all that, who doesn't want to go under the hot sun in the beaches sometimes

			You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br>
			And I got that red lip classic thing that you like<br>
			And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
			'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style<br>
			You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt<br>
			And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt<br>
			And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
			'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style<br>
